                <h2>Trump masters his dangerous game</h2>
                <section>
                    <img src="images/trump.webp">
                    <p><strong>(CNN) - </strong>Donald Trump fixed reporters with a hard gaze and declared: "I'm a very nonpolitical person, and that's why I got elected President."</p>
                    <p>Like much of what Trump says, his comment required a large helping of salt, since it came in a session in which his considerable, instinctive and often cynical political prowess was on full display 14 days before the midterm elections.</p>
                    <p>With reporters and lawmakers huddled around his Oval Office desk Tuesday, Trump floated conspiracy theories, boasted about his achievements, bent facts, teased future announcements and dipped into a well of racial and cultural prejudice.</p>
                    <p>Such behavior is more often displayed by autocratic leaders who rule in personality cults than by more cautious and conventional politicians who operate in democratic systems, but it also explains how Trump has bullied much of Washington into submission.</p>
                    <p>With a chatty intimacy that tempted his audience into his confidence, Trump dominated the Oval Office, coming across as a president increasingly bullish about himself and at ease in wielding his power.</p>
                    <p>"I'm not worried about anything," he said.</p>
                    <p>Including a later photo-op at a meeting with military leaders, Trump has now chewed the fat with reporters 12 times in 11 days, and conducted a blizzard of interviews with radio and television stations.</p>
                    <p>With his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders and political strategists confined to the wings, the President has seized control of the midterm election campaign, and it looks as if the GOP will rise or fall depending on how voters react.</p>
                    <p>Trump's virtuoso flexing of his significant but often diabolical political skills came on a day when he had no campaign rally. So he just manufactured a moment to add more fuel to the rhetorical blaze he has ignited over immigration.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>'No proof of anything'</h3>
                    <p>The caravan of desperate migrants from Central America might be more than 1,000 miles and many days from the US border in Mexico, but that is not stopping the President from whipping it into the perfect political storm.</p>
                    <p>The now-famous column is becoming the 2018 equivalent of then-FBI director James Comey's late reopening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, which dominated the final few weeks of the 2016 presidential race.</p>
                    <p>Then, Trump used the issue to hammer home his theme -- that his Democratic foe was corrupt, a liar and unfit for office -- in the process papering over his own character liabilities and drowning out her attacks.</p>
                    <p>Two years on, Trump is using the caravan in a similar shock and awe assault on the airwaves, bolstering his dark claims that a human tide of outsiders from Central America is laying siege to US borders, bringing crime, violence and even terrorism.</p>
                    <p>Pictures of massing migrants bolster his theme, even though he rips them out of context and ignores reporters on the ground who are able to show that his claims that the column includes "Middle Easterners" are likely false.</p>
                    <p>Many in Clinton's camp believe, in retrospect, that the blanket coverage of the email issue stalled her momentum and helped Trump's late surge to victory.</p>
                    <p>It's unclear if the caravan holds the same potential for Trump this time around. But it helps him reach voters who sincerely believe that other politicians have done nothing as their wages are undercut by undocumented migrants and their jobs have disappeared.</p>
                    <p>And the spectacle of the march means the President will likely have the opportunity to loudly tout his extreme take on immigration, an issue on which he has built his political career, every day until the midterms November 6.</p>
                    <p>It also allows him to fold in other themes that animate the Republican base, which he needs to come out in near 2016 numbers to stave off Democratic gains.</p>
                    <p>That's one reason why he has stoked fear and played into prejudice about "Middle Easterners" -- code for Muslims -- who he hints, without providing evidence, are in the crowd, coming America's way and may be bent on terrorism.</p>
                    <p>Ever eager to please, Vice President Mike Pence appeared at the President's shoulder, explaining that it was "inconceivable" that such people were not in the column, placing the burden of proof on those who doubt the claim.</p>
                    <p>But pressed by CNN's Jim Acosta, Pence was not quite as adept at shading truth as the President, who jumped in and said some "real bad ones" from the Middle East had been intercepted at the border recently.</p>
                    <p>Pence, who has spent the last two days defending Trump's claims on the caravan, then got a reminder of how treacherous life can be on the President's team. The vice president was promptly crushed as Trump reversed a rhetorical bus over him.</p>
                    <p>"There's no proof of anything. There's no proof of anything. But they could very well be," Trump said, before deftly switching the conversation to a debate about the size of his crowd at a rally in Texas on Monday night.</p>
                    <h3>Sticking a knife in with a smile</h3>
                    <p>The President also unsheathed another skill common to other accomplished politicians: his use of humor to twist a knife, in this case in the unfortunate Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who had effectively been held captive after a photo-op to sign a water infrastructure bill.</p>
                    <p>After Pence said the caravan was financed by leftists, Trump turned to Carper and teased: "And the Democrats maybe?"</p>
                    <p>On Trump's face was the grin of a man who knows he has power over others and can make outrageous claims and get away with it.</p>
                    <p>If his rising approval rating and dominance of the agenda in the days running into the midterms with a campaign based on fear and untruths help Republicans hang on to the House and perhaps increase their Senate majority, a comment by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the CNN CITIZEN conference in New York on Monday will look prescient.</p>
                    <p>"The more time I spend with him working with him, the more I realize I don't bet against his instincts," Kushner said, despite polling and historical data that suggest Trump could be heading for a bloody nose in two weeks.</p>
                    <p>"He's a black swan. He's been a black swan all of his life," Kushner said, suggesting there was something unpredictable and unexplainable about his father-in-law's talents.</p>
                    <p>However, despite dominating his immediate circle and delighting his base, Trump is a politician with an approval rating in the mid-40s who could end up constrained by a Democratic-led House next year, a scenario that could have been brought on largely part by his extreme behavior and fear-based leadership.</p>
                    <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, one Democrat who's itching to take on Trump, hinted Tuesday at the possibility that Americans will reject the President when he said: "This President is more like George Wallace than George Washington!" -- referring to the late populist firebrand and former Alabama governor.</p>
                    <p>"We have to choose truth over lies. We have to choose a brighter future for Americans over this desperate grip of the darkest element of our past in our society," Biden said in Florida.</p>
                    <p>Still, Democrats running for president might wind back Trump's performance on Tuesday afternoon for a reminder of what a dangerous opponent -- ready to go low and relishing his own power -- the President could be in two years.</p>

                <h2>New research on horse eyesight could improve racecourse safety</h2>
                <section>
                    <img src="images/horse1.webp">
                    <p><strong>(CNN) - </strong>The way horses see the world is almost entirely differently to that of humans -- from the distances they can see, to the colors they can process.</p>
                    <p>New research carried out by the University of Exeter not only provides a better understanding of equine vision, but also demonstrates how the information can be used to improve racecourse safety.</p>
                    <p>Crossbars and take-off boards for fences and hurdles have long been painted orange, based on what humans can see.</p>
                    <p>But according to research led by Martin Stevens, a professor of sensory and evolutionary ecology at the University of Exeter, horses see orange as a shade of green -- meaning the fences currently used by the industry simply blend into the grass.</p>
                    <img src="images/horse2.webp">
                    <p>Janel L. Jones, who has a PhD in cognitive science, writes in Equus Magazine that details humans can see from a distance of 30 feet, can only be seen by a horse from 20 feet.</p>
                    <p>"A horse has to be 50% closer to see the same details," she says. "A 50% deficiency is enough for any rider to consider ... even in sunshine, the horse's view of a jump is blurry, hazy, dim, vague ... all the adjectives you'd rather not ponder as you're galloping 30 feet per second towards a big oxer that could ruin your day."</p>
                    <p>Researchers from the University of Exeter experimented with changing the color of obstacles to white and yellow.</p>
                    <p>While this didn't necessarily mean the horses could see the fences any better, the different colors did change the way the animals jumped.</p>
                    <p>Researchers hope this study -- conducted in collaboration with the British Horseracing Authority and the RSPCA -- will improve the welfare and safety of horses and jockeys by reducing the risks of falls and injuries.</p>
                    <p>Stevens explains that horses only have two types of cone cells in their eyes, compared to humans who have three.</p>
                    <p>"Basically it means they can only see colors that we only perceive as blues and yellows and they can't tell the difference between reds and greens," he said.</p>
                    <p>So researchers compared the orange markers used at race courses with a wider range of alternative colors.</p>
                    <p>"What we did was take some of those colors that might be more visible and perform some behavioral trials in a training environment with horses to see how they are affected by other jump colors (through) their jumping behavior and distance," Stevens explained.</p>

                    <h3>Photographs help convince industry to make changes</h3>
                    <p>By using a camera that is able to interpret certain wavelengths of light, researchers were able to transform photographs to illustrate how a horse might see colors in a particular environment.</p>
                    <p>"We make comparisons in terms of how visible colors are against different backgrounds, for example how a take-off board is against foreground turf, how visible an orange midrail is against a background fence and things like that," added Stevens.</p>
                    <p>"Then we can really start to quantify just how visible those things should be to a horse."</p>
                    <p>The color orange has been used in racing for quite some time -- mostly for human benefit -- and while Stevens says it's known in the scientific community what colors horses can and can't see, there wasn't any research to quantify that in a racing environment.</p>
                    <p>"I think sometimes there isn't always a link up between what's known in the scientific literature and what's known outside of science," he says. "There hadn't been any work that actually quantified just how visible the orange markers would be to a horse."</p>
                    <img src="images/horse3.webp">
                    <p>David Sykes, Director of Equine Health and Welfare at the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), said that the research has provided a photographic demonstration of the significant differences between what horses and humans see.</p>
                    <p>"They've been able to do that and really convince us and validate to us that's exactly what a horse is seeing and what you and I can see ... and I can see there's a definite distinction," Sykes told CNN.</p>
                    <img src="images/horse4.webp">
                    <p>The research is a proactive step to improve equine welfare in horse racing, says World Horse Welfare chief executive Roly Owers.</p>
                    <p>"Our understanding of equine vision is continually developing but often this is not given enough consideration," Owers told CNN in a statement.</p>
                    <p>"World Horse Welfare therefore welcomes the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) trial on new fence and hurdle design as it is incumbent on racing to minimize welfare and safety risk as far as possible.</p>
                    <p>"We are hopeful that by better delineating the edges of the fences and hurdles, the risk of falls and fatalities will be further reduced."</p>
