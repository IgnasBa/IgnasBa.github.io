                            <p><strong>Know what to expect after you get a new dog</strong><br><br>
                                Whether you got a puppy or an adult dog, there will be some kind of adjustment period after your new dog comes home. Prepare in advance and be patient. Adult dogs usually need more adjustment time, especially if they lived in a shelter for a while. On the other hand, puppies usually need more training (especially house training).
                                Have everything set up at home and make a plan for everything before your new dog comes home. This will help you get off to a great start.</p>

                            <p><strong>Meet Your Dog's Basic Needs</strong><br><br>Now that you're a proud dog owner, you must master the basics of dog care. At the very least, every dog needs proper nutrition, adequate shelter, physical care, and social interaction. Once you can cover the basics, you'll be on your way to giving your dog an amazing life.</p>

                            <p> <strong>Find a Great Veterinarian</strong><br><br>Every dog needs a great vet! One of the first places you should go with your new dog is to see the vet. Your veterinarian will not only look out for your dog's health, she will also educate about your dog and guide you through the world of dog ownership. Find a veterinarian you love with a great staff and team. Most of all, always keep the lines of communication open. </p>

                            <p><strong>Choose the Right Dog Food</strong><br><br>Your dog's diet is the foundation of his health. But with so many dog foods to consider, you may find yourself getting overwhelmed. There's no one right answer when it comes to dog food. You can choose one of our PerfectFit food options. One rule of thumb: if your dog is doing well on a certain dog food, then it's probably the right one (as long as it's complete and balanced). </p>

                            <p><strong>Dog Training is Essential</strong><br><br>Every dog should be trained. Dog training not only helps you control your dog; it gives your dog a sense of structure. In the long run, proper training can make both you and your dog happier. Plus, it will enhance the special bond you two share. Take a little time each day to train your dog, working through all the essential steps of dog training.</p>
